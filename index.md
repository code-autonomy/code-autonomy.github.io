## Overview

The project we chose to do was Manoa Club Connect. This website offers three distinct user roles, each authenticated via their UH ID. Standard users navigate through the directory, while Club Administrators possess the authority to modify their club's associated data. Super Administrators oversee the site's content integrity and selectively give "Club Administrator" privileges.

The platform goes beyond mere alphabetical club listings, enabling users to refine searches by interest categories such as athletics, arts, music, etc. Clubs can align with multiple interest categories.

Users have the option to specify their interest categories, receiving notifications when new clubs matching their preferences emerge or existing clubs incorporate those categories.

Administrators have the responsibility of monitoring the platform for inappropriate content and are empowered to introduce new categories reflecting musical preferences, capabilities, and objectives.

The Manoa Club Connects project utilizes GitHub for version control and collaboration, Meteor as the web framework, React for building user interfaces, and IntelliJ IDEA as the integrated development environment (IDE) for coding and development tasks. These technologies and resources facilitate efficient development and deployment of the project.

## Features
* **Roles** (users, admin): users can buy or sell goods and services, while administrators monitor user behavior and manage categories and other functionalities.
