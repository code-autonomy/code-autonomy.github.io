## Overview

The project we chose to do was Club Hub. This website offers three distinct user roles, each authenticated via their UH ID. Standard users navigate through the directory, while Club Administrators possess the authority to modify their club's associated data. Super Administrators oversee the site's content integrity and selectively give "Club Administrator" privileges.

The platform goes beyond mere alphabetical club listings, enabling users to refine searches by interest categories such as athletics, arts, music, etc. Clubs can align with multiple interest categories.

Users have the option to specify their interest categories, receiving notifications when new clubs matching their preferences emerge or existing clubs incorporate those categories.

Administrators have the responsibility of monitoring the platform for inappropriate content and are empowered to introduce new categories reflecting musical preferences, capabilities, and objectives.

## Features
* **Roles** (users, admin): users can buy or sell goods and services, while administrators monitor user behavior and manage categories and other functionalities.
* **Categories**: feature broad categories for interests and services.
* **Notifications**: users can opt to receive information via text message.
* **Browse clubs**: Browse by interest area(s).
* **Photos**: supports upload of photos.
* **Complaints**: users can report inappropriate content or users.

## Team
Code Autonomy is designed, implemented, and maintained by Byron Soriano, Cristian Milanes, Luis Hernandez, Joshua Asuncion, and Eisen Oallesma.

Once logged in, the Admin home page allows the admin to manage and moderate user accounts, services, and issues.

### User-Profile page
The User-Profile page displays user's information (username, profile picture, and bio).

The Categories page provides a list of categories of topics for users to select from.

### Matching page
The Matching page will contain the matching algorithm that will align the user's interests and hobbies with other users to match with.
